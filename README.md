# Fraud-Detection-Modeling-for-Credit-Card-Transactions
This project investigates the effectiveness of machine learning models in identifying fraudulent transactions in a large dataset of over 550,000 records featuring European cardholder transactions from 2023. With scaled features and anonymized names for privacy, the dataset provides a robust foundation for model development. The goal is to train and evaluate various machine learning algorithms to distinguish legitimate from fraudulent transactions, assessing their accuracy and performance. The findings of this project will contribute to the development of efficient fraud detection systems, enhancing the security of financial transactions and minimizing potential losses for cardholders and financial institutions.
